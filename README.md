# MV-MEF
Here is the prelimenary implementation guideline towards our work "Multiview Multi-Exposure Fusion and Contrast Enhancement using Single Image, WITH UNKNOWN EXPOSURE AND GEOMETRY " #The MATLAB code relies on: #Image rectification #MaxFlow v3.01 library (http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/) #VLFEAT library (www.vlfeat.org/) #Learning-based Backlit Image Restoration project. #Scale invariatn feature transform (SIFT Descriptor )
