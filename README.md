#Multiview Multi-Exposure Fusion and Contrast Enhancement using Single Image. 
Here is the prelimenary implementation guideline towards our work where "ILL-ILLUMINATION is ENHANCED IN-THE-WILD MULTIVIEW BACKLIT IMAGES WITH UNKNOWN EXPOSURE AND GEOMETRY "
#The MATLAB code relies on:
#Image rectification
#MaxFlow v3.01 library (http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/)
#VLFEAT library (www.vlfeat.org/)
#Learning-based Backlit Image Restoration project.
#Scale invariatn feature transform (SIFT Descriptor )
